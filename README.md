# study-notes
Notes repository to help me track my study progress

## What it's all about
This repository was created to keep track of everything I am studying and have studied so far.
Notes are supposed to be added at the end of each study day with a description of what I have learned, code snippets, insights, details that I found particularly exciting or hard. 

This is meant to help me track the tools I have learned, return to the parts I may have forgotten or simply check my understanding of new knowledge at the end of the week.
